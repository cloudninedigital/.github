# Cloud Nine Digital
This organization holds any repositories that are used within Cloud Nine Digital and its clients.

## Project conventions
### Internal repositories
Internal repositories are any repositories that might be used by tools made for the team or by more than one client. Such repositories should target generic functionality such as handling API calls or handling Analytics data. For easily recognizing internal repositories, the following naming convention should be followed:
```
cnd-<some-functionality>
```

See a few examples of internal repository names below:
```
cnd-magento-api
cnd-survio-api
cnd-universalanalytcs-api
cnd-googleanalytics4-api
cnd-facebook-api
cnd-tools
cnd-authentication
cnd-generic-api
```

### Client projects
Client project repositories should contain code that usually cannot be reused by any other client or tool inside the organization. For these repositories the naming convention is as follows:
```
<client-name>-<project-name>
```
See a few examples below:
```
fleurametz-marketingdatatobq
staatsbosbeheer-enquetedashboard
```
